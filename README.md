A config file will be generated in the same directory as the executable when running for the first time or when a config is not present. This file holds the width and height of your display, as well as your selected display. The primary display is "0", subsequent displays will be "1", "2", etc and the config will need to be manually edited to change which display the background appears on with a multi-screen setup.

This uses WinForms, so only runs on Windows.
